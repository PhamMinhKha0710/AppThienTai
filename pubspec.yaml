  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/on_boarding_images/
    - assets/images/animations/
    - assets/images/banners/
    - assets/images/brands/
    - assets/images/dashboard/
    - assets/images/forget_password/
    - assets/images/products/
    - assets/images/profile/
    - assets/images/splash_images/
    - assets/images/welcome_images/
    - assets/images/reviews/

    - assets/logos/

    - assets/icons/
    - assets/icons/brands/
    - assets/icons/categories/
    - assets/icons/payment_methods/

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
